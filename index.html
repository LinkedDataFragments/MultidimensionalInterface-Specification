        Different Linked Data interfaces to expose data with various fragmentation strategies exist.
        <a href="#bib-SPARQL">SPARQL</a> [[sparql11-update]] endpoints, for example, offer highly selective access to data,
        while a datadump offers no fragmentation.
        This document specifies a <em>Multidimensional Linked Data</em> interface,
        through which ordinal data can be consumed that is fragmented in a certain way.
        Clients can consume this by navigating through an interface-level index to select their desired data.

        <h3>Aim, scope, and intended audience</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of a <em>Multidimensional Interface</em> is to provide efficient selective access to ordinal Linked Data.
        </p>
        <p>
            This document defines the <em>Multidimensional Interface</em>, which is a collection of interfaces
            that clients can use to navigate through multidimensional ordinal Linked Data.
        </p>  
        <p>
            This document is intented for people who want to implement a Multidimensional Interface on a server,
            who want to implement a client that is able to consume such an interface, or for those who want to understand
            how these servers and clients work.

          using the following namespace prefixes:

      <h2>Overview</h2>
	  <p>
		  <a href="#bib-LINKED-DATA">Linked Data</a> [[LINKED-DATA]] can be exposed on the Web through different kinds of interfaces.
          Some of these interfaces are more expressive than others.
          A <a href="#bib-sparql11-update">SPARQL</a> interface for example is more expressive than a Linked Data dump because
          a client can be more selective in its queries.          
	  </p>
      <p>
          <a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/linked-data-fragments/">Linked Data Fragments</a> [[!HYDRA-LDF]] is a framework
          that provides a uniform view on all possible interfaces to publish Linked Data.
          This framework defines the concept of a <em>Linked Data Fragment</em> of a <em>Linked Data dataset</em>,
          which is a set of triples that consists of the following parts:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>data</dt>
        <dd>
          all triples of this dataset that match a specific selector;
        </dd>
        <dt>metadata</dt>
        <dd>
          triples that describe the dataset and/or the Linked Data Fragment;
        </dd>
        <dt>controls</dt>
        <dd>
          hypermedia links and/or forms that lead to other Linked Data Fragments.
        </dd>
      </dl>
	  <p>
		  When we are publishing <em>n-dimensional ordinal data</em> that contains numbers, dates, geospatial locations or even genomic ranges,
          we may want to enable clients to select data by an n-dimensional range, in order to make their queries more selective.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  A Multidimensional Interface is a collection of structured interfaces through which clients can navigate to find certain subsets
          of ordinal data based on certain multidimensional ranges.
	  </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>
        A <em>Multidimensional Interface</em> can be defined over <dfn>n-dimensional resources</dfn>,
        which are <a href="#bib-RDF">RDF</a> resources with n properties whose ranges are strict linearly ordered sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <dfn>Multidimensional Interface</dfn> on a given dataset is a collection of interfaces containing the following elements:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Range Fragment</dt>
        <dd>
          A Linked Data Fragment that has an interval as selector, which apply to dimensional resources at one of its n dimensions.
        </dd>
        <dt>Range Gate</dt>
        <dd>
          A Linked Data interface through which Range Fragments can be selected by interval.
          This interface selects all Range Fragments whose interval overlap with the Range Gateâ€™s interval.
        </dd>
        <dt>hypermedia controls</dt>
        <dd>
          A Range Gate MUST contain hypermedia controls
          that allow to retrieve Range Fragments of the given dataset.
          This MUST either be provided as a form
          that allows to choose the initial and final elements of the selector's interval.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          A Range Gate MAY contain additional hypermedia controls.
		  The IRIs of data, metadata, and control triples entities SHOULD be dereferenceable.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          A Range Fragment MAY contain hypermedia links to more selective Range Gates on that fragmented subset of the original dataset.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>          
        A Range Fragment of a dataset is fully determined and identified by its <em>triple pattern selector</em> and <dfn>interval selector</dfn>.
		This interval selector consists of two components <code>initial</code> and <code>final</code> which form a interval.
        The <code>initial</code> MUST either be a variable, an ordinal literal or an ordinal IRI;
        the <code>final</code> MUST either be a variable, an ordinal literal or an ordinal IRI;
        These components MUST NOT be blank nodes.
      </p>

      <p>
		  The above constraints define the document type of a Multidimensional Interface.
		  The following sections <a href="#range-fragment"></a> and <a href="#range-gate"></a> explain this in more detail.
      </p>

      <p>
		  Multidimensional Interfaces are not bound to a specific syntax because different methods can be used to represent its data, metadata, and controls.
		  The server MUST, however, support at least one RDF-based representation that MUST allow for triples to be represented.
		  For allowing clients to correctly parse requests Multidimensional Interfaces, servers MUST indicate the correct MIME type when sending responses.
      </p>

    <section id="range-fragment">
      <h3>Range Fragment</h3>
      <p>
		A Range Fragment is a Linked Data Fragment of a dataset.
        This fragment is defined by a certain interval and a dimensional resource over which the interval is defined.
        This fragmentation is done for exactly one dimension of the dimensional resource over which the Range Fragment is defined.
      </p>
      <p>
		The dimensional resource type <em>GPS position</em> could be fragmented by <em>longitude</em> and can therefore have several
        Range Fragments which consist of all dimensional resources that are within a certain longitudal range.
      </p>
      <p>
		Each Range Fragment MUST define the following metadata:
      </p>
<pre><code>&lt;http://example.org/range-fragment-0-100&gt;
        a mdi:RangeFragment;
        mdi:initial "0";
        mdi:final "100".</code></pre>
      <p>
		A Range Fragment MAY define a link to a more selective Range Gate as follows:
      </p>
<pre><code>&lt;http://example.org/range-fragment-0-100&gt;
        mdi:hasRangeGate &lt;http://example.org/range-fragment-0-100/range-gate&gt;.</code></pre>
      <p>
		Such a more selective Range Gate starts from the given Range Fragment as the datasource,
        and allows further fragmentation of that datasource.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="range-gate">
      <h3>Range Gate</h3>
      <p>
		A Range Gate is a Linked Data Fragment that exposes fixed Range Fragments.
        The Range Gate MUST provide a control to select Range Fragments by providing an interval.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Range Gate control MUST be expressed as a form in the
        <a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/">Hydra Core Vocabulary</a> [[!HYDRA-CORE]]
        using triples in the controls graph.
      </p>
<pre><code>&lt;http://example.org/range-gate&gt
        a mdi:RangeGate;
        hydra:search [
            hydra:template "http://example.org/range-gate{?initial,final}";
            hydra:mapping  [ hydra:variable "initial"; hydra:property mdi:initial ],
                           [ hydra:variable "final"  ; hydra:property mdi:final ]
        ].</code></pre>
      <p>
          The interval selector is used to lookup all Range Fragments that overlap or are within with the selected interval.
          The selected interval must be interpreted as starting from initial, including initial up until final, excluding final.
      </p>
	  <p class="note">
		  Not providing the initial or final parameter, means that search interval has no limit for that element.
          If we for example only provide initial and omit final, the Range Gate MUST provide all elements starting from initial.
          If we only provide final and omit initial, the Range Gate MUST provide all elements until initial.
